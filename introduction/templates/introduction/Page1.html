    <h5>Data Usage</h5>
    We are kindly requesting you to participate in a financial choice experiment. During the experiment we use your
    personal data (name, student ID and e-mail) in order to be able to process your bonus points and a potential
    financial payoff (see below). However, we will anonymize your identity after those awards are handled and not share
    it with any other party. We also keep the data on a password protected computer and destroy the data within three
    years from now. You may earn real money in the experiment (as a gift card in Akademibokhandeln) but, of course, you
    are not exposed to any risk of losing money from your own pocket. The experiment does not play a role in the grading
    of this course, other than the two bonus points in the MCQ's you will earn if you complete the three tasks.<br>
    <br>
    Before proceeding to the experiment please complete the data privacy consent form below.<br>
    <br>
    <h5>Data Privacy Consent</h5> <br>
    <h6>I hereby confirm that I participate in this experimental research project on a voluntary basis and give my permission</h6>
    <h6>to process my data and choices which I made and use them for academic research.</h6> <br>
