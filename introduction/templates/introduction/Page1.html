    <h5>Data Usage</h5>
    We are kindly requesting you to participate in a financial choice experiment. During the experiment we use your
    personal data (name, student ID and e-mail) for the payoff purposes, however we will anonymize your identity
    after the experiment is over. We also keep the data on a password protected computer and destroy the data within
    three years from now. You may earn real money in the experiment but you are not exposed to risk of losing money
    from your own pocket. The experiment does not play a role in the grading of this course and you are free to refuse
    to participate if you have objections.<br>
    <br>
    Before proceeding to the experiment please complete the data privacy consent form below.<br>
    <br>

    <h6>to process my data and choices which I made and use them for academic research.</h6> <br>
